# Explodium Breathing Engines
Modified jet engines, explodium vapour intakes, and oxidizer tanks for Kerbal Space Program 1.2.2's planet Eve. Also includes a Resources definition for "ExpVapour" (Explodium Vapour), which should be found in Eve's atmosphere only. Intended as a jet engine counterpart to OhioBob's Eve Optimized Engines.

These are configuration files only, no software. This is also a work in progress. MIT License similar to OhioBob's part pack.

With the conversion of the intakes to atmospheric harvesters, the ExpVapour harvesters now only work on Eve, or any planet that has ExpVapour added as an atmospheric resource. Harvesters require manual activation, but otherwise work like the original intakes. If you're using Alien Space Programs or have hacked in a resource configuration for Kerbin, I'd suggest using the Brakes action group to deploy the harvesters, then use the Stage action group to start them.

Engine specific impulse is 45% of the originals, to reflect needing 2.21 times as much OX and ExV to get the same amount of energy as the original engines based on an oxygen-RP1 reaction, while maintaining the original thrust. The Wiki explains the chemistry and engineering involved, and they could use further tuning.

Visible engine plumes replaced with blue plumes where appropriate, to match methane / ethane reactions with oxygen. RealPlume configurations are available if you have RealPlume Stock and SmokeScreen 2.7.4 installed.

To install, download a release and copy the contents of GameData to your own GameData folder. Also install a current edition of Module Manager to your GameData folder. If you're also installing RealPlume Stock, this comes with a supported Module Manager edition already.
