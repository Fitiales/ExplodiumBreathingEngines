The ne# Explodium Breathing Engines
Modified jet engines, explodium vapour intakes, and oxidizer tanks for Kerbal Space Program 1.2.2's planet Eve. Also includes a Resources definition for "ExpVapour" (Explodium Vapour), which should be found in Eve's atmosphere only. Intended as a jet engine counterpart to OhioBob's Eve Optimized Engines.

These are configuration files only, no software. This is also a work in progress. MIT License similar to OhioBob's part pack.

With the conversion of the intakes to atmospheric harvesters, the ExpVapour harvesters now only work on Eve, or any planet that has ExpVapour added as an atmospheric resource. Harvesters require manual activation, but otherwise work like the original intakes.

The engines are tuned based on ethane chemistry, where the KSP Wiki entry for Eve suggests an atmosphere of 90% carbon dioxide and 10% ethane. It takes 0.375 U pure ethane or 3.75 U ExpVapour per 1 U oxidizer to produce about 16% of the energy as 1 U liquid fuel per 3.8 U oxygen or 38 U intake air assuming Kerbin has 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. Engine ISP values edited to use 6.16 times more oxidizer and an appropriate amount of ExpVapour based on the original jet engine performance. Values are based on chemistry suggested here:

This engine tuning is subject to change, as some ISP values are pretty pathetic for jet engines now.
