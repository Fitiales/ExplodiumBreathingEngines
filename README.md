# Explodium Breathing Engines
Modified jet engines, explodium vapour intakes, and oxidizer tanks for Kerbal Space Program 1.2.2's planet Eve. Also includes a Resources definition for "ExpVapour" (Explodium Vapour), which should be found in Eve's atmosphere only. Intended as a jet engine counterpart to OhioBob's Eve Optimized Engines.

These are configuration files only, no software. This is also a work in progress. MIT License similar to OhioBob's part pack.

With the conversion of the intakes to atmospheric harvesters, the ExpVapour harvesters now only work on Eve, or any planet that has ExpVapour added as an atmospheric resource. Harvesters require manual activation, but otherwise work like the original intakes.
