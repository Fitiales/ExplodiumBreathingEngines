# Explodium Breathing Engines
Modified jet engines, explodium vapour intakes, and oxidizer tanks for Kerbal Space Program 1.2.2's planet Eve. Also includes a Resources definition for "ExpVapour" (Explodium Vapour), which should be found in Eve's atmosphere only. Intended as a jet engine counterpart to OhioBob's Eve Optimized Engines.
These are configuration files only, no software. This is also a work in progress. MIT License similar to OhioBob's part pack.
Currently these parts 'cheat' by taking atmosphere and calling it 'ExpVapour.' It's my intention to make this an atmospheric resource found only on Eve, but the ExpVapour intakes currently work on any planet with an appreciable atmosphere.
