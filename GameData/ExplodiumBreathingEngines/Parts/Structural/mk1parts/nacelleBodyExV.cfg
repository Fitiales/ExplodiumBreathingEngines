	@description = The Engine Nacelle is a self-contained solution for powering explodium-breathing engines. It includes some reserve oxidizer, making it a very practical option. C7 Engineers assure us that these units are quite safe, and that the dents and burn marks will give yours a more unique look. Optimized for subsonic flight; includes very powerful static suction.
